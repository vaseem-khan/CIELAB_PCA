####CIELAB Analysis Using Principal Components Analysis 

**Abstract** :Made a conclusion that we required to use of only two features(AB) of CIELAB for applications in facial recognition domain.

**Algorithms used**: PCA was run on data sets in CIELAB format and euclidean distance between principal components are used to check whether features are matching. 

**Tools and Languages used**: Matlab, C++, Python
